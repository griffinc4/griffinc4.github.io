  <h1>My Goal:</h1>
  <p>My SMART goal was to improve on my annotations. While I have stayed more focused on my annotations while working, I still do not think that I have done the best work that I think that I could have done.</p>
  <h1>My Strength:</h1>
  <p>My strength was my love of reading. This has helped me to understand the books we have read in class, and to comprehend the information better.</p>   
  <h1>My Stretch:</h1>     
   <p>My stretch was my lack of organization. This can sometimes cause me to make careless errors due to my lack of neatness. Also, my binders and lockers are often messy, and disorganized. </p>   
   <h1>Mid-Year Reflection Questions and Responses</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>How broad is your friend group? Are peers easily accepted (within your friend group and/or outside of your group)? What have you done/can you do to change the social atmosphere within your group of friends, grade-level, or school?</li>
        <p>My friend group is very broad. Peers are easily accepted. My friends say that I have changed the social atmosphere at the Rhoades School.</p>
    <li>How have you contributed to our community this year? Provide examples of any leadership roles you have assumed or how you have been a role model (these examples can be academic, social, or from extracurricular activities). How have you grown as a leader/role model, or what are some ideas on how to assume these roles in the future?</li>    
        <p>I have contibuted to the community by volunteering at Casa de Amistad, by volunteering as a referee at a charity soccer tournament, and by writing the introduction for the Water for South Sudan pamphlet. I have been a leader in soccer, football, and basketball by occasionally being a team captain. In cross-country and track, I am a role model to younger athletes. In theater, I help younger actors, and I am a role model for them. These experiences and opportunities have helped me to grow as a leader.</p>
        <li>Are you consistent with completing work on time? What is hindering/helping you?</li>
        <p>I am consistent with turning in my work on time. However, I generally procrastinate on everything, especially on my annotations.</p>
