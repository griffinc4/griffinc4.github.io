<h1>Extracurricular</h1>
    <body>Outside of school, I participate in many extracurricular activities. Some of these include:
   <ul>
   <li>Soccer: I am a Cal South referee, and I won the 2019 LAGSD Referee of the Year award.</li>
   <li>Football: I am a member of the Dartmouth Big Green NCCFNL team.</li> 
   <li>Basketball: I am a member of the Rhoades School basketball team. We were the 2019-2020 IMSL champions, and entered the playoffs as the #1 seed, with an undefeated league record.</li>  
   <li>Track and Field: I was a Rhoades School "Rhoaderunner".</li>   
   <li>Cross-Country: I am a Rhoades School "Rhoaderunner".</li>
   <li>Theater: I recently played Mr. Wormwood in Matilda, as well as playing a Parent/Big Kid/Henchman, and helping the stage crew.</li> 
   <li>Music: I am a member of the band Variation 5, also known as Four. I have played the piano, the drums, the guitar, the bass, the congos, the bongos, the digeridoo, and the triangle. I also write music, and often write songs with and for the rapper L!l Munk.</li>       
        </ul>
    These extracurricular have made me a better leader, a better team player, and a better person. The sports that I participate in, such as soccer and football, have helped me to grow my physical strength, while the arts I practice, such as theater and music, have helped me to grow my mental strength.
